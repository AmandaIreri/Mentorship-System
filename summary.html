            In Chapter 1 Trevor Noah briefly introduces us to apartheid which he explains as ‘apart hate’. Apartheid uses tribal divisions among a big majority of black South Africans to "divide and conquer" by assigning slightly different social statuses to various groups and making sure they fight each other rather than uniting against the white government, majorly the Zhulu and the Xhosa. He describes his mother as religious and how they attended three churches: mixed, white and black. He describes the violence in his neighborhood after Nelson Mandela was released, which did not stop his mother from taking them to school and going to work. He recalls when he was nine when his mother threw him out of a moving car which started with their car breaking down but their mother insisted on catching a minibus. The driver of the minibus judges Patricia, for being a Xhosa woman who was stereotyped as unfaithful and arrogant and plans on teaching them a lesson by speeding off. They jump out of the car and take off running and when they stop, they argue about the occurrence. The chapter ends with Trevor asking his mother if next time Jesus can meet them at their house instead which is humor amidst a tough time.

Chapter 2 is about how Noah was born a crime, a result of his mother(Xhosa) and his dad(Swiss/German). He explains how his mother was fearless. From moving out of Soweto to Johannesburg (which was reserved for the whites) for a secretarial job. In the city, people don’t trust each other until she meets Robert, Trevor’s father, trusts him and spends more time with him where she insists on asking him to give her a child, without having to act as a father to the child. Trevor was born in 1984 and his mother sacrificed a lot to protect him. First by concealing his father’s origin at the hospital and by hiring a colored woman to walk him in the park. Trevor spent most of his early childhood playing alone and indoors even when he went to his grandmother’s place. This is because they feared he would be grabbed by the police. After all, his color made him not belong to Soweto. Later, he meets other mixed South Africans his age and is astonished they had an option of leaving.

From the two topics, the issue of tribalism arises. I am from Embu County and you find that there is a perception about other tribes. In the interiors of Mbeere, it is so hard for people to intermarry with tribes, especially from the West. It is not considered a crime but most of them are married to fellow tribesmen. We also get the aspect of religion, relating to the black church, a lot of churches in our region have that energy and the church goes on and on for hours, it’s like for an eternity. The last issue is on parenting, Patricia is like a figure of most mothers back at home, in terms of discipline where Trevor Noah recalls always running from her mother to evade being hit. And she would throw anything, just like most mothers back at home.
