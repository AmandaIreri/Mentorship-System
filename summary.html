            In Chapter 1 Trevor Noah briefly introduces us to apartheid (‘apart hate’)which was used to "divide and conquer" South Africans. He describes his mother as religious, a disciplinarian and fearless. He recalls when he was nine when his mother threw him out of a moving car. A minibus driver judged Patricia for being a Xhosa woman who was stereotyped as unfaithful and arrogant and plans on teaching them a lesson by speeding off. Patricia saves his children by throwing Noah off and jumping out of the car. Despite the tough times, Trevor is good at portraying humor.

Chapter 2 is about how Noah was born a crime, a result of his mother(Xhosa) and his dad(Swiss/German). He describes his mother as fearless. She moved out of Soweto to Johannesburg (which was reserved for the whites) for a secretarial job. Trevor was born in 1984 and his mother sacrificed a lot to protect him. By concealing his father’s origin at the hospital to hiring a colored woman to walk him in the park, Trevor spent most of his early childhood playing alone and indoors because of his mixed color. When he later meets other young, mixed-race South Africans, he is shocked to learn they had a choice to leave the country.

From the chapters, tribalism arises. As someone from Embu County, I can relate to the stereotypes surrounding other tribes. We also have the religious component, which is related to the black church. Many churches in our area have that intensity, and services last for hours and hours. The final topic is parenting.  Patricia is similar to most mothers in his childhood in that she is strict and always Trevor was always running away from her to avoid getting slapped. Like most mothers back home, she would throw anything.
